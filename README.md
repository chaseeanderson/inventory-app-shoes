## GA PROJECT 4 // A FULL-CRUD MERN-STACK WEB APP 
&nbsp;
#### This is an interactive web app that manages one's shoe inventory!
&nbsp;
> _The user is able to create orders to a vendor using a pre-existing database of shoes. The user can enter a quantity and price for each shoe, as well as a commission percentage. 
> The submitted order will automatically update the user's current inventory and be stored in a list of submitted orders!_
